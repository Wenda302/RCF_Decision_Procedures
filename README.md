# RCF_Decision_Procedures
(Univariate) decision procedures in Isabelle/HOL based on Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition

Compatible with Isabelle2021.

Examples are in [Univ_RCF/Univ_RCF_Example.thy](Univ_RCF/Univ_RCF_Example.thy).

To use the **univ_rcf** tactic, the environment variable MATH_KERNEL should point to an executable of Mathematica Kernel. This can be set in  `~/.isabelle/Isabelle2021/etc/settings`. For example, you may want to add `MATH_KERNEL="/Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel"` to your *setting* file in the MacOS.
