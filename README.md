# RCF_Decision_Procedures
(Univariate) decision procedures in Isabelle/HOL based on Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition

Compatible with Isabelle2020.

Examples are in [Univ_RCF/Univ_RCF_Example.thy](Univ_RCF/Univ_RCF_Example.thy).

To use the **univ_rcf** tactic, the environment variable MATH_KERNEL should point to an executable of Mathematica Kernel. This can be set in ~/.bashrc (e.g., export MATH_KERNEL='/usr/local/bin/MathKernel').
