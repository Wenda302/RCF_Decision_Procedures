\title{Real Algebraic Numbers}
\author{Wenda Li}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This is part of the artefact of the paper at CPP 2016 \cite{Li_CPP_16}. It provides a pseudo-constructor for real algebraic numbers, accompanied by a verified sign determination procedure for univariate polynomials at these algebraic points based on the Sturm-Tarski theorem \cite{Sturm_Tarski-AFP}. In addition, it also provides a formalisation of real algebraic numbers on the abstract level (i.e. without executability). Compared to what has been described in the paper \cite{Li_CPP_16}, this entry does not provide executable arithmetic for real algebraic numbers. For those who want executable algebraic arithmetic, please check the entry by Ren√© Thiemann and Akihisa Yamada \cite{Algebraic_Numbers-AFP}.
